        <h1>Programmers</h1>
        <p>His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy  <br>
        There's build errors already, his code is spaghetti <br>
        He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready <br>
        To start debugging, but he keeps forgettin' <br>
        The code he wrote down, has no comments at all <br>
        He starts to type, but more build errors are comin' out now <br>
        He's choking, how, tabs and spaces are mixing now <br>
        The breakpoint runs out, null exception, blaow!<br>
        404, oh there goes code quality!<br>
        Oh, there goes overflow, he choked<br>
        He's so mad, but won't give up that easy? No<br>
        He won't have it, he knows this whole repo's a joke<br>
        It don't matter,<br>
        All that's left is to type in disgrace,<br>
        'git rebase'</p>
